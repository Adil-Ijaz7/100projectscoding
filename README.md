# 100ProjectsOfCode
A list of practical knowledge-building projects. As the projects are aimed to increase your knowledge base, they are somewhat challenging. However, there are a few easy ones too. Many of them are even worthy enough to showcase on your portfolio.   
The projects are divided into multiple categories and tagged with some suggested languages and frameworks/tools to get you started.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project ideas:
1. Pick a project from the list
2. Create a GitHub repository for the project
3. Start working, possibly from scratch (reinvent the wheel if you have to!)
4. When done, test it, and share with the tag #100ProjectsOfCode somewhere in the README of the repo
5. Fork this repo
6. Check the completed item, and repeat with another project idea
