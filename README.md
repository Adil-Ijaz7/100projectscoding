# 100ProjectsOfCode
A list of practical portfolio-worthy projects. As the projects are aimed to be worthy of putting on your portfolio, they are somewhat challenging. However, there are a few easy ones too.  
The projects are divided into multiple categories and tagged with some suggested languages and frameworks to get you started.

To get started, simply fork this repo and tick off the checklists.
