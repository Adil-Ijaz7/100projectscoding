# Learning Resources

Apart from the list of projects to code, the most common other query that people have is **where can I learn coding from?**  
This file is my attempt to compile a list of resources (tagged with languages/frameworks) that will help you learn how to code and hone your skills. Currently, the list is haphazard, but I'll soon arrange it in some fashion (either alphabetically, or by languages).
