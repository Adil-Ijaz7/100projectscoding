# Learning Resources

Apart from the list of projects to code, the most common other query that people have is **where can I learn coding from?**  
This file is my attempt to compile a list of resources (tagged with languages/frameworks) that will help you learn how to code and hone your skills. Currently, the list is haphazard, but I'll soon arrange it in some fashion (either alphabetically, or by languages).

## MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is THE resource for anything related to web. It is a massive resource that covers languages and topics like CSS, HTML, web standards, protocols, JavaScript, and other things. Their tutorials are great for beginners to learn the basics, and their references are great for experienced developers when they need a quick find.

**Free/Paid:** Free  
**Languages/Frameworks:** CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and almost everything related to the web.
